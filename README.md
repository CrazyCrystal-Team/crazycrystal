#### This is a QOL hack of pokecrystal. It includes @SoupPotato's fabulous sprites from his pokecrystal_SpriteBase repo, with decapitalization, the Bag,
#### new music, and some things from @Rangi42's polishedcrystal.


##### Special thanks:
#### Thanks to @Duramax-Tech-co, for putting up with all of the base switches(we're finally done :D)
#### Thanks to @itsdarsh for putting up with me, the random guy who has no clue what he's doing
#### Thanks to @SoupPotato for his amazing sprite rework.
### Thanks to @pret for the pokecrystal disassembly
